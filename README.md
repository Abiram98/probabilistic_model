## Describe a problem/dataset for which a probabilistic model can be used for
analysis.

## Design a probabilistic model for solving the problem.

## Implement your model in Pyro.

##Use the implementation to perform an analysis, for example:
Learn and apply a classifier
Perform Bayesian inference to compute distributions over quantities of
interest (e.g., parameters, latent variables, etc.)

## Document your approach and findings in a short report (3-5 pages).
